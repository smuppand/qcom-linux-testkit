# FastRPC Test Script for Qualcomm Linux-based Platforms

## Overview

The **fastrpc_test** runner validates FastRPC (Fast Remote Procedure Call) on Qualcomm targets,
offloading work to all supported DSP domains (ADSP, MDSP, SDSP, CDSP, CDSP1, GDSP0, GDSP1).
It wraps the public [fastrpc test application](https://github.com/quic/fastrpc) with **robust
logging, parameter control, and CI-friendly output**.

Supported capabilities:
- Uses `fastrpc-healthcheck` when available to discover online DSPs, FastRPC support, signed and
  unsigned PD support, firmware information, and DSP library paths. The reported DMA-BUF system
  heap state is retained and logged as a diagnostic because the healthcheck documents it as
  informational rather than a FastRPC execution gate.
- When healthcheck is unavailable, discovers runnable domains from remoteproc state and FastRPC
  character endpoints. The fallback cannot discover PD support directly, so it uses the documented
  conservative protocol map. The fallback recognizes both `sdsp` and the public `slpi` remoteproc
  identity for the sensor DSP. Host, test, and DSP skeleton libraries remain runtime-discovered.
- Multiple iterations with a required finite timeout.
- Precise control over binary location via `--bin-dir`.
- Line-buffered output through `stdbuf` when available.

## Features

- **Calculator**, **HAP**, and **Multithreading** examples (as provided by `fastrpc_test`)
- CI-ready logs with timestamps and per-iteration, per-domain/PD results
- Parameterized control (`--arch`, `--repeat`, `--timeout`, `--bin-dir`, `--domain-mode`,
  `--domain`, `--domain-name`, `--pd-mode`, `--unsigned-pd`, `--verbose`)
- Auto-discovery of system libraries and DSP skeletons for both Yocto and Debian layouts
- Runtime domain and PD discovery without SoC-name filtering

## Prerequisites

Have these on the target (or specify paths with the flags below):

- `fastrpc_test` binary (from [github.com/quic/fastrpc](https://github.com/quic/fastrpc))
- Optional `fastrpc-healthcheck`. When installed, this is the primary distro-independent
  capability source. An installed healthcheck that fails, times out, or produces an
  unrecognized or malformed report fails the suite. Runtime fallback is used only when the tool
  is absent.
- FastRPC system libraries and DSP skeletons auto-discovered from standard locations:
  - Yocto: `/usr/local/lib`, `/usr/local/lib/fastrpc_test`, `/usr/local/share/fastrpc_test`
  - Debian: `/usr/lib/<multiarch>`, `/usr/lib/<multiarch>/fastrpc_test`, `/usr/share/fastrpc_test`
  - RPM-based images: `/usr/lib64`, `/usr/lib64/fastrpc_test`, `/usr/share/fastrpc_test`
- A selected DSP skeleton directory must contain the complete calculator, HAP example, and
  multithreading skeleton set. Discovered directories are prepended to the semicolon-separated
  `DSP_LIBRARY_PATH` used by the public `fastrpc_test` utility while preserving existing DSP
  search entries. The same merged value is exported through the domain-specific library paths.
- Optional but recommended:
  - `stdbuf` for line-buffered output. Execution remains bounded without it.
- The suite does not install packages at runtime. Missing optional image assets are reported as
  SKIP unless the operator explicitly selected a domain whose required runtime library is absent.

## Usage

### Script arguments

```
Usage: run.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --arch <name>                    Architecture (only if explicitly provided)
  --bin-dir <path>                 Directory containing 'fastrpc_test' (default: /usr/bin)
  --domain <0|1|2|3|4|5|6>        DSP domain: 0=ADSP 1=MDSP 2=SDSP 3=CDSP 4=CDSP1 5=GDSP0 6=GDSP1
  --domain-name <name>             DSP domain: adsp|mdsp|sdsp|slpi|cdsp|cdsp1|gdsp0|gdsp1
  --domain-mode <all-supported|single>  Discover all domains or run only one (default: all-supported)
  --pd-mode <both|signed-only|unsigned-only>  Select PD mode(s) to run (default: both)
  --unsigned-pd                    Use '-U 1' (user/unsigned PD). Overrides --pd-mode.
  --repeat <N>                     Number of repetitions (default: 1)
  --timeout <sec>                  Timeout for each run (default: 120, must be greater than zero)
  --healthcheck-timeout <sec>      Timeout for fastrpc-healthcheck (default: 15)
  --verbose                        Extra logging for CI debugging
  --help                           Show this help

Env:
  FASTRPC_DOMAIN=0|1|2|3|4|5|6    Forces one domain; CLI --domain/--domain-name wins.
  FASTRPC_DOMAIN_NAME=adsp|...     Forces one named domain; CLI wins.
  FASTRPC_UNSIGNED_PD=0|1          Sets PD (-U value). CLI --unsigned-pd overrides to 1.
  FASTRPC_EXTRA_FLAGS              Extra flags appended (space-separated).
  FASTRPC_HEALTHCHECK_BIN          Optional path to fastrpc-healthcheck.
  ALLOW_BIN_FASTRPC=1              Permit using /bin/fastrpc_test when --bin-dir=/bin.
```

### Quick start

```bash
# Default: dynamically discover runnable domains and supported PD modes
./run.sh

# With repeat and timeout:
./run.sh --repeat 3 --timeout 60
```

### Common scenarios

```bash
# 1) Use a custom binary directory
./run.sh --bin-dir /tmp/stage/usr/bin

# 2) Run only unsigned (user) PD across all domains
./run.sh --pd-mode unsigned-only

# 3) Run only signed PD
./run.sh --pd-mode signed-only

# 4) Force a specific domain (CDSP)
./run.sh --domain 3
# or by name:
./run.sh --domain-name cdsp

# 5) Force GDSP0 with unsigned PD
./run.sh --domain-name gdsp0 --pd-mode unsigned-only

# 6) Run SDSP via environment variable with unsigned PD
FASTRPC_DOMAIN=2 FASTRPC_UNSIGNED_PD=1 ./run.sh

# 7) Run multiple iterations with verbose logs
./run.sh --repeat 3 --timeout 120 --verbose

# 8) Allow /bin explicitly (generally discouraged)
ALLOW_BIN_FASTRPC=1 ./run.sh --bin-dir /bin
```

Domain selection uses `CLI > environment > dynamic discovery` precedence. A non-empty
`FASTRPC_DOMAIN_NAME` or `FASTRPC_DOMAIN` selects one domain even when `--domain-mode` remains at
its `all-supported` default. `--domain-mode single` without a CLI or environment domain is invalid.
An explicitly selected domain fails when it is unavailable, lacks its runtime library, or does not
support the requested PD mode. Automatic selection from the runtime fallback excludes domains
without complete remoteproc and endpoint evidence. When `fastrpc-healthcheck` reports an online,
FastRPC-supported domain, a missing endpoint or required runtime library is treated as a broken
installation and fails the suite.

### LAVA integration example

```
- $PWD/suites/Multimedia/CDSP/fastrpc_test/run.sh --bin-dir /usr/bin || true
- $PWD/utils/send-to-lava.sh $PWD/suites/Multimedia/CDSP/fastrpc_test/fastrpc_test.res || true
```

## CI debugging aids

- **Capability source**: The startup log reports `capability_source`, `domain_source`, and
  `pd_source`, plus the healthcheck system-heap status when available. Whenever healthcheck is
  executed, its raw output is retained. A normalized six-column table containing domain, state,
  signed-PD support, unsigned-PD support, normalized FastRPC support, and the support reason is
  retained only when strict parsing succeeds.
- **Offline automatic domain**: Logged and excluded from automatic selection. Other runnable
  domains continue.
- **Unsupported automatic domain**: Logged with the healthcheck reason and excluded. Other
  runnable domains continue.
- **Offline explicitly requested domain**: Fails with the healthcheck or remoteproc state.
- **Missing runtime artifacts**: When the capability source is `fastrpc-healthcheck`, a domain
  missing its endpoint or required runtime library fails the suite — healthcheck has declared it
  supported, so the absence indicates a broken installation. When the capability source is the
  runtime fallback, such a domain is logged and excluded while other runnable domains continue.
  Missing shared test libraries or DSP skeletons skip the suite before execution.
- **Binary resolved to /bin/fastrpc_test**: Blocked by default. Set `ALLOW_BIN_FASTRPC=1` or
  use `--bin-dir` to a non-`/bin` path.
- **Session create errors with -U 1**: If unsigned PD returns `0x80000416`, confirm your image
  includes unsigned shells/policies (or use `--pd-mode signed-only`).
- **Domain not discovered**: Check `dmesg` for remoteproc firmware load errors. The test
  requires the DSP remoteproc to be registered and its firmware present in DT.
- **Per-iteration logs**: `logs_fastrpc_test_<timestamp>/<domain>_<pd>_iter<N>.out` (+ `.rc`, `.env`, `.cmd`)
- **Kernel evidence on failure**: one shared `logs_fastrpc_test_<timestamp>/kernel/` snapshot is
  captured through `scan_dmesg_errors` after the invocation matrix.
- **Summary result file**: `fastrpc_test.res` (`PASS` / `FAIL` / `SKIP`)
- **Verbose mode**: adds environment, library resolution, and timing details

## Notes

- Domain and PD support are derived from `fastrpc-healthcheck` when available. The fallback is
  selected only when the tool is absent and uses runtime remoteproc and endpoint evidence, with
  a conservative protocol mapping for PD support.
- The existing `/usr/lib/dsp` compatibility links are prepared before healthcheck captures its
  capability report, so the report and the subsequent functional run observe the same layout.
- This suite runs the public `fastrpc_test` character-device path and therefore requires either
  `/dev/fastrpc-<domain>` or `/dev/fastrpc-<domain>-secure` for every selected domain.
- DSP skeleton directories are discovered dynamically by locating `.so` artifacts instead of
  assuming fixed ABI directory names such as `v68` or `v75`.
- Override library discovery with `FASTRPC_LIB_SYS_DIR`, `FASTRPC_LIB_TEST_DIR`, or
  `FASTRPC_SKEL_BASE`. CLI domain selection takes precedence over environment selection, which
  takes precedence over runtime discovery.
- If `fastrpc_test` is not in the default path, use `--bin-dir` to specify its location.
